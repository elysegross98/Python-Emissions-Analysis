# Python-Emissions-Analysis
This is an analysis of US CO2 emissions. I used data from the EIA (Energy Information Agency) that breaks down emissions by power plant. This data allowed me to analyze the relationships between Generation of Energy (kWh), Tons of CO2 Emissions, and Fuel Consumption at each plant. This data also includes information about location and fuel type of each plant, allowing my analysis to delve deeper into characteristics. Additionally, I included a data set with each state's CO2 emissions in Millions of Metric Tons over time (from 1970-2019). This allowed me to conduct temporal analysis. The goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability to use Python for machine learning and time series analysis.
